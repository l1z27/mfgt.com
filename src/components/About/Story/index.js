                    <h1 className='title'>Our Founder's Story</h1>
                    <p>Colin Baird first began his journey into exploring transformational leadership and operational excellence in 2008. While he had no intention of turning around the operations of companies experiencing a financial crisis, he did have hope he could one day better understand and turn around the psychological dynamics that had for many years, pushed he and his father apart.</p>

                    <p>His father and mother, both History and English teachers, taught him the incredible value and joy that comes from learning and acquiring new knowledge. And it was that intrinsic joy he received from learning new things about science, engineering, math, and psychology that ultimately pushed him to study transformational leadership, cultural awareness, and the differences between Japanese and American Management Theory. </p>

                    <p>To understand what it was like to grow up without a father as his father had, Colin began studying history throughout the post WWII era. First diving into European culture, then finding nothing unique about the cultural accomplishments resulting from the Marshall Plan that General Marshall had put in place, his father suggested he might begin studying the Potsdam Declaration and the long-term friendship and relationship between General Douglas A. Mac Arthur and Emperor Hiro Hito, and the special relationship Dr. Deming had forged over 40 years lifting the Japanese people out of the crisis situation Japan faced in 1945.</p>

                    <p>Fascinated by the General's approach to improving people and process--while still retaining the cultural aspects of an already creative and curious nation, Colin began studying additional leaders who made it possible for Japan to succeed during and after Mac Arthur's leadership and tutelage had expired.</p>

                    <p>Colin's devotion and respect for the work of Homer Sarasohn, Charles Protzman, Dr. Deming, and Dr. Shingo Shingo began to help him formulate and move forward on his personal and professional transformation. </p>

                    <p>As he was further exploring the primary pillar of Japanese Leadership--respect for people, one day he approached a Management Consultant and asked if he could tag along on a few assignments.</p>

                    <p>After a few years of working alongside that Japanese master in Lean Leadership, Colin was fortunate enough to be hired by a well-known international Management Consulting group, where he would gain even more skills in Operational Excellence, Plant Operations, Jishuken, and Kaizen.</p>

                    <p>Today, Colin leads <strong>Manufacturing Turnarounds</strong>, where he works closely with Bankers, Restructuring Agencies, Restructuring Officers to improve operations, leadership, and communications. </p>

                    <p>When he's not flying around the country on a commercial airliner, he can be found where his passion for learning always seems to take him: Where value is created and he can best develop leaders and employees who make it possible to continually improve people, process, and profits. </p>

                    <p><strong>Manufacturing Turnarounds</strong> now works with over thirty well known Lean Manufacturing Consultants, Lean Leadership Coaches, and Experts in Communications, and Organizational Psychologists. Each of our consultants delivers value with a common mission, aim, and purpose: Save companies while continuously <strong>improving people, process, and profits.</strong></p>
